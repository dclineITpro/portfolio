# DJ Cline - Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The site is deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Development

To run the project locally, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

<!-- Trigger deployment again -->

## Note on AI Lab

The experimental AI Lab section and related provider integrations have been removed to streamline the portfolio.
